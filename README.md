numbers,

[Numbers](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers) are something unique (*not at all*), there are infinite [numbers](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers)  but there are finite humans, finite minds. Interesting right?

Wanna make a number yours ***(here)***? If there are infinite [numbers](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers), some [numbers](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers) have never been written. You can be the first human who write any.

## [How to](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/fork)
If you want, just go and write that [number](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers) in a paper (*you also can make a collage or something like that, it must be a picture*), take a picture and add it to the [numbers](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers) folder with the name `{number}.png`.
Finally open a pull request with the name of the [number](https://github.com/victorioxd/numbers/tree/main/numbers).

Only one pull request each day.
